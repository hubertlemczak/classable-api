# Classable - API Spec

## Getting Started

1. You can view the API Spec [here](https://hubertlemczak.github.io/classable-api/)
2. Run the Classable server on `http://localhost:4040`
3. Register a user account via the `/register` endpoint. You can send a request by clicking the `Try it out` button on the right hand side and then `Execute` after you entered your details.
4. If the request is successful you can copy your Bearer `token` and paste it into the `Authorize` field at the top of the page, or by clicking on the padlock on one of the protected endpoints.
5. After the token is authorized you will notice the padlocks become `locked` and you can now access the other protected endpoints.

Note that your Bearer token may not have access to all endpoints.
